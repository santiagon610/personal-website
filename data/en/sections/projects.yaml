    summary: |
      When an existing OpenStack infrastructure was on the chopping block, it was time to
      move some legacy Angular SPAs from their Nginx VMs to Kubernetes. Moving the build
      process from Maven to GitLab CI was easy, and creating a commonized Helm chart to for
      the dozen legacy web apps made the integration and migration a breeze.
