  - name: Linux
    icon: "/images/sections/skills/linux.png"
    summary: |
      On a day-to-day basis, my containers and servers run varied 
      distributions of Linux. Though I can run just about any desktop
      operating system, Linux is my happy place. Red Hat, Debian, Alpine,
      something else: no worries. Let's do this.

  - name: Git
    icon: "/images/sections/skills/git.png"
    summary: |
      Source control is the foundation of good continuous delivery.
      While most comfortable in GitLab (and using its CI), I'm no
      stranger to GitHub.

  - name: Docker
    icon: "/images/sections/skills/docker.svg"
    summary: |
      It works in my container. It's the 2018 equivalent of "but it
      works on my local," and I'm not even ashamed. Being able to run
      the same exact environment from local, to test, to production - is
      key in ensuring a stable and predictable environment.

  - name: Kubernetes
    icon: "/images/sections/skills/kubernetes.png"
    summary: |
      I can deploy applications on Kubernetes better than I can pronounce it.
      I'm pretty sure that's more important, honestly. I have Helm and
      Terraform to help me roll these apps out.

  - name: Amazon Web Services
    icon: "/images/sections/skills/aws.svg"
    summary: |
      This site is hosted in AWS. Lots of my projects run in AWS. It's all
      orchestrated programmatically and just works.

  - name: Ansible
    icon: "/images/sections/skills/ansible.svg"
    summary: |
      Automate everything. Don't install agents. Ansible made many years of
      working on infrastructure easier, and is still one of my favorite
      tools on the belt.

  - name: Terraform
    icon: "/images/sections/skills/terraform.png"
    summary: |
      Programmatically building and enforcing state of infrastructure by
      running a simple pipeline is pure and utter magic. This is a huge
      part of why I love Terraform.
