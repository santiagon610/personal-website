    summary: |
      On a day-to-day basis, my containers and servers run varied 
      distributions of Linux. Though I can run just about any desktop
      operating system, Linux is my happy place.

      GitHub as well.

  - name: Ansible
    icon: "/images/sections/skills/ansible.svg"
    summary: |
      Automate everything. Don't use agents. Ansible made many years of working on infrastructure easier, and is still one of my favorite tools on the belt.

  - name: Terraform
    icon: "/images/sections/skills/terraform.png"
    summary: |
      Programmatically building and enforcing state of infrastructure by running a simple pipeline is pure and utter magic. This is a huge part of why I love Terraform.
