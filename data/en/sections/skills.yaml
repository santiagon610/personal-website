  - name: Linux
    icon: "/images/sections/skills/linux.png"
    summary: |
      On a day-to-day basis, my containers and servers run varied
      distributions of Linux. Though I can run just about any desktop
      operating system, Linux is my happy place. Red Hat, Debian, Alpine,
      something else: no worries. Let's do this.

  - name: Git
    icon: "/images/sections/skills/git.png"
    summary: |
      Source control is the foundation of good continuous delivery.
      While most comfortable in GitLab (and using its CI), I'm no
      stranger to GitHub.

  - name: Docker
    icon: "/images/sections/skills/docker.svg"
    summary: |
      It works in my container. It's the 2018 equivalent of "but it
      works on my local," and I'm not even ashamed. Being able to run
      the same exact environment from local, to test, to production - is
      key in ensuring a stable and predictable environment.

  - name: Kubernetes
    icon: "/images/sections/skills/kubernetes.png"
    summary: |
      While at first, it cost me a lot of sleep, Kubernetes has since become
      the thing that helps me sleep at night. Its declarative nature of
      managing deployed apps, and plethora of sysadmin tools, have made me
      come to embrace the abstract.

  - name: Oracle Cloud Infrastructure
    icon: "/images/sections/skills/oci.svg"
    summary: |
      Most of my recent experience has been in OCI, due to their flexible and
      cost-effective approach to cloud computing. While they're not the most
      ubiquitous cloud provider, they are certainly growing on me.

  - name: Amazon Web Services
    icon: "/images/sections/skills/aws.svg"
    summary: |
      Most of my production workloads run in AWS, using its wide variety of
      managed products. Whether I'm using EC2 VMs, an EKS cluster, CloudFront
      distributions in front of S3 storage for static content, AWS usually has
      something to offer me to efficiently deliver my product.

  - name: Terraform
    icon: "/images/sections/skills/terraform.png"
    summary: |
      Programmatically building and enforcing state of infrastructure by
      running a simple pipeline is pure and utter magic. This is a huge
      part of why I love Terraform.

  - name: Ansible
    icon: "/images/sections/skills/ansible.svg"
    summary: |
      Automate everything. Don't install agents. Ansible made many years of
      working on virtual machines and consuming REST APIs easier, and is still
      one of my favorite tools on the belt.

  - name: Python
    icon: "/images/sections/skills/python.svg"
    summary: |
      Admittedly, I'm a noob at any real development language, but Python is the
      one that makes the most sense to me at the moment and the one I'm working
      hardest on learning.
